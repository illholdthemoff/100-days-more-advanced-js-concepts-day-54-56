function greetUser(userName) { // username here is a variable used just for this function, it cannot be used anywhere else.
    console.log("Hi " + userName);
}

greetUser("moff"); // moff is passed in as the variable value, so when we use it, it will say "Hi moff"

If username is left empty, ie if the function is simply called as greetUser(), it will return "Hi undefined" because the username is undefined.
If instead we write

function greetUser(userName = "user") {
    console.log("Hi " + userName);
}

calling greetUser() instead will return "Hi user". We can still call greetUser("moff") or whatever and have it print the username instead, this just gives 
a default value in case we don't have a name entered.
Specifically adding a real username in the parameters of greetUser() will replace the default because it is more specific.

IF YOU TAKE IN MULITPLE parameters within a function, the ones that have default parameters ("user") must be at the end of the list.
example, if greetUser function is instead "function greetUser(greetingPrefix, userName = "user")" you notice that the defaulted is at the end.

function addNums(...number) - the ... here is a special operator (REST PARAMETER) that basically lets you add as many parameters as you would need.
This basically means that w edon't have to print or get the result as an array, js will convert it back for us. Ironically if you
pass in an array as your parameter, it will not work properly since ... expects a bunch of items to turn into an array, not an array of items already.
Thus you will get an unexpected answer
NOW IF YOU USE ... with an array, it will instead turn it back into a list of values instead (IN THIS FORM KNOWN AS THE SPREAD OPERATOR),
 thus allowing it to work for addNums(...number)
example below

function sumUp(...numbers) {
    let result = 0;
    for (const number of numbers) {
        result += number;
    }
    return result;
}
console.log(sumUp(...inputNumbers)); // returns 37

So to sum up, the spread parameter pulls out items from an array and provides them as standalone values

REST PARAMETER - combine any amount of received parameters into an array, used in parameter lists when defining function
syntax function findMin(...values) {
    //function code ...
}

SPREAD OPERATOR - split array OR object values into a comma separated list of values, used in any place where an array or object needs to be split up
syntax const values = [5, 3, 10];
Math.max(...values);

Related, the built-in functions Math.min() and Math.max() both want lists of values, NOT arrays

Something also to note, Functions are themselves objects. for example if you take the sumUp function from functions.js and log it with no parameters,
you will see [Function: sumUp]
You get a better example if you do it in browser. For example if you open up and f12 etc, and do function add(num1, num2) {return num1 + num2},
and you console.dir(add); you get the following:
add(num1, num2) {
    arguments: null
    caller: null
    length: 2
    name: "add"
}
Just like (because it is) an object, with key: value pairs that are inferred automatically.
This is relevant in the case of expressJS
When we called express, we required it, and then called it like a function as so: const app = express(); which created the app object.
Now in other areas of the code, we used the express function to access properties on that function. This was possible because the developers of expressJS
added custom properties to the express function to add more functionality to it.
REMEMBER you can add properties to whatever object on the fly, for example we could have add.someOtherProperty, and if we dir it in the browser
console we will see someOtherProperty: null
This is why express could be used as a function and also an object, because at the core, FUNCTIONS ARE OBJECTS

TEMPLATE LITERALS - /allows you to have multi line strings with line breaks and lets you plug in dynamic values (like variables) neatly. example
console.log(`${variable1} test text text ${variable2}`) // note the back ticks instead of quotes.

Arrays, like Functions, are also OBJECTS, therefore the appending something originally not in the array but it working is similar, though the syntax
is different. instead it is arrayName.push("thing")

//Primitive Values = numbers, strings, bools, undefined etc
//Reference values = Objects
These are typically stored in different parts of memory, due to the complexity of Objects
more detailed:
Primitive values are stored in a more basic kind of memory, don't occupy much space, are 'cheap' to copy therefore, and the VALUES THEMSELVES 
ARE STORED IN VARIABLES OR CONSTANTS
Reference values are stored in different more advanced comp memory, can occupy a lot of space, hence they are 'expensive' to copy, and ONLY ADDRESSES
OF VALUES are stored in variables or constants (address or pointer)

The reason why, by the way, that you are able to do arrayName.push("whatever") into const arrayName is because what is stored is not actually the
value of the array or the array itself, rather a pointer to that array, basically its address in memory. So when you push a new value to the array
the value is added to the existing array in memory BUT THE ADDRESS doesnt change, therefore it works

speaking of reference values not wanting to be copied, as seen in behind-the-scenes.js, you notice that when you use p.age to subtract and have insert person 
as the value, it actually subtracts the age from person itself, despite it being a constant. Remember, as a reference value, it doesn't copy and therefore
modifies the original in memory
